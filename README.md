# lets-meet-algorithm
**Implementation of an algorithm to find potential meeting opportunities of two people represented by their calendars in such a way that they do not conflict with any other meeting recorded in the calendar. The parameter is the expected length of the meeting. In response, we receive a list of time intervals that can be used by both people during working hours.**
